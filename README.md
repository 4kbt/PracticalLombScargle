# PracticalLombScargle

This repository contains the source for my paper, Understanding the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (preprint available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09824)

> The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is a well-known algorithm for detecting and characterizing periodic signals in unevenly-sampled data. This paper presents a conceptual introduction to the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and important practical considerations for its use. Rather than a rigorous mathematical treatment, the goal of this paper is to build intuition about what assumptions are implicit in the use of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and related estimators of periodicity, so as to motivate important practical considerations required in its proper application and interpretation.


## Code

All the code is contained in Jupyter notebooks in the [figures](figures) subdirectory.
Currently the organization of the code is somewhat haphazard; once the paper goes through review I'll attempt to organize the notebooks more clearly.
